**Teaching Evaluations/Comments from Students (Fall 2023)**

- This class was well setup and I think Jun taught it very well.

- He was an amazing teacher! It was clear that he is newer to teaching, but his dedication to improving himself and helping his students reach their full potential was even more clear. He is
very knowledgeable about the course content and made sure students knew what content/subjects were the most important to know and learn, which is a GREAT quality in a teacher.

- Even though it was a smaller course, he constantly encouraged/pressured us to reach out to him. This is another amazing quality in a teacher, as it shows that they want to make the time
for their students and form a strong relationship. He is super helpful with questions and he never made it feel like a burden if a student did not understand a concept or question and
wanted to reach out (he is one of the only teachers who never made me feel like a burden when I had questions. I was never nervous to stop into his office hours). He tried out several
different teaching methods to see what worked best for his students and I think that is also super impressive, because it shows that he is constantly trying to improve himself. Overall, Jun
Huang is a wonderful teacher and I would recommend his class to anybody!

- Great to have Dr. Huang for the first time at SDSU. An exceptional lecturer who loves to get the class engaged in course material.

- I enjoyed all interactions I had with the professor at all times of day.
