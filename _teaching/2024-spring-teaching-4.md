**Teaching Evaluations/Comments from Students (Spring 2024)**

- You're a great instructor and I'm glad that you were the one teaching this class. You always answered our questions and made sure we understood the content and provided what was going to on the exam which was very helpful. Only recommendation I have is that we do some examples of the homework questions in class before the homework is due so we have a template to follow.

- I really enjoyed this class and his teaching style. I appreciated that he would review the previous class the next class period each time. I felt like I actually learned a lot about computer networks, even though a lot of the content was very difficult to understand. The final programming assignment was difficult for me, and I wish he would've given us a little more guidance. I like how he was always wanting students to come talk to him in office hours. I'm not usually a student that goes to office hours, but I did for this class.

- Dr. Huang is an excellent professor I have ever met. He always tried to help me and tried to explain everything if I had a problem with a topic. He is really helpful to his students. He encourages students to learn new things.

- I would just maybe suggest giving a little less assignment for the fact that students have other academic commitments, and these deadlines create added stress. Otherwise, you are one of the best professors I came across at SDSU because you show passion for your subject. Thank you for your service.

- I commend Dr Huang for a great semester. He went out of his way to ensure we understand the course, he was always available to assist during office hours and anytime you needed him. This course was truly enjoyable. Thank you Dr Huang!
