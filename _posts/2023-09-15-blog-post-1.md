Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) generate and process privacy-sensitive data and require efficient use of communication, computation, and storage resources. To address this, federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while protecting data privacy, as it keeps training data on individual clients and shares locally trained models. Combining FL with edge computing in AVS creates an integrated FL-Edge system, leveraging available vehicle resources and enabling ubiquitous intelligence. However, deploying FL in MEC-empowered AVS faces challenges due to diverse system capabilities, heterogeneous data distributions, and the dynamic networking environment.
