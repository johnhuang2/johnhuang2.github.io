Our paper, "FedTD3: An Accelerated Learning Approach for UAV Trajectory Planning," has been accepted by the International Conference on Wireless Artificial Intelligent Computing Systems and Applications (WASA) 2025.

In this work, we optimized the **Federating** component using a Flower-based implementation and addressed the **UAV return** issue, which can hinder RL exploration, compared with our previous [TMC work](https://johnhuang2.github.io/posts/2025/02/blog-post-2/).
