I am looking for two self-motivated Ph.D. students working on Federated Learning in Wireless Networking and Mobile Computing areas starting in **Spring/Fall 2025**. Two (Research/Teaching) Assistantships are available. Please email me your CV, Transcript, and Publication (if any). More information about the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at SDSU can be found [here](https://catalog.sdstate.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=48&poid=10990).
