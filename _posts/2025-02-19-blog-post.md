It’s really just a small work, nothing to write home about—definitely not rocket science. Bragging about it left and right is just going to make people jealous. If I had to find a use for it, I guess it’s just an extra little "bonus" when my student is applying for his status or credentials.

But let's get to the point—though it’s a small work, I think it still has some worth and meaning. Using reinforcement learning to solve UAV communication problems isn’t exactly groundbreaking, but the slow learning process is a classic issue in mobile communication and computing. Luckily, I had the pleasure of teaching "Operating Systems". Using multithreading technology and a dash of federated learning magic, I designed a parallel training framework to speed up training. I named it FedX (yep, just like that famous courier company, no coincidence there!). The "X" part? Well, it can be any well-known reinforcement learning algorithm you like. Obviously, FedX isn’t perfect—what is? We’ll be posting the code for this paper on GitHub soon, and we’re hoping it’ll spark some new ideas. Please, experts, go easy on me!
