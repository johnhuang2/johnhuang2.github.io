title: "Project 4: Managing the Internet of Things (Completed)"
excerpt: "<center><img src='/images/IoTJ.png' width='600'></center><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a spectrum of mechanisms to manage the Internet of Things (IoT) effectively and efficiently.  Since the things are typically wireless sensors or RFID tags, which all have limited computing power and energy capacity, we started by proposing an energy-efficient hierarchical IoT architecture design. Since the proposed architecture does not require sensors equipped with sophisticated modules and runs complex routing mechanisms, it is expected to be flexible, scalable, and manageable.  To deal with the potential chaos of medium access caused by massive machine-type communications, we presented an access control mechanism to ensure the quality of services and the sustainability of IoT systems in smart cities.  We also developed a lightweight and cost-effective multicast routing algorithm for multimedia communications in IoT systems.  A network-coding-based, relay-assisted, and bi-directional data transmission scheme was formulated as to the efficiency of data transmissions in IoT systems.   Interestingly, this scheme reveals the following fact: the time-varying feature of the state information of the wireless channel between two IoT objects can be utilized in the network coding technique to achieve a specific system performance gain."
