title: "Project 5: Quality-of-Service Control in Composite Network-Cloud Service Provisioning (Completed)"
excerpt: "<center><img src='/images/convergence.png' width='600'></center><br/>This project aims to improve the end-to-end performance of Cloud service delivery and the quality of experience for end users. To this end, we first presented two service models -- the communication-as-a-service (CaaS) model and networking-as-a-service (NaaS) model, and then proposed a network-Cloud service provisioning architecture. In this architecture, CaaS and NaaS models allow communication and networking resources to be virtualized, exposed as services, and integrated with Cloud computing resources resulting in a framework of composite network-Cloud services. New service composition algorithms were designed, analyzed, and tested in congruence with the proposed architecture.  The testing results show that these new algorithms are effective and resilient in selecting services for the network-Cloud service composition and in guaranteeing the end-to-end performance of the composite service provisioning. As a step toward real-world applications, we implemented a network-Cloud content-sharing system by leveraging the paradigm of software-defined networks (SDN) on the Internet. Other associated research topics, such as the controller placement in SDN and the competition among network/Cloud service providers, were thoroughly investigated during the implementation process."
