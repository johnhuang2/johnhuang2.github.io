title: "Project 1"
excerpt: "This project aims to design task offloading schemes for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the assistance of mobile edge computing.  We began with an overview of in-vehicle networking, where the current in-vehicle networking technologies are summarized, compared, and analyzed.  We advocated automotive Ethernet and presented a priority-based scheduler to reduce the cost of wire harnesses and guarantee delay-constrained performance. With the Ethernet being installed in vehicles, the barrier for vehicular communications and networking is significantly lowered.  After briefly discussing the essential elements of the Internet of autonomous vehicles, such as architecture, features, and socio-technological issues, we plan to propose a three-layer task offloading scheme for the intelligent IoV with the aim of minimizing the overall energy consumption while satisfying the delay constraint of end users.   Due to the extraordinarily complex nature of the problem in question, we will devise a deep reinforcement machine learning technique-based method.  Performance evaluations for our proposed method and their optimized variations will be conducted using real-world taxicab data in Shanghai and Hangzhou, China.  Our approach is expected to be highly practical and efficient for task offloading and intelligent caching in large-scale vehicular networks.
The significance of this work can be summarized as follows. First, to reduce the cost of wire/cable harnesses, which is among the top three expenditures in a vehicle, a priority-based scheduler is proposed within the framework of the automotive Ethernet architecture. This scheduler has shown its ability to guarantee the stringent delay requirements inside the vehicle and thus provides a new guideline for future vehicle scheduler designs. On the other hand, traffic congestion caused by the ever-increasing number of vehicles results in around 5 percent of fuels purchased by Americans being wasted on roads.  In fact, according to a report from the U.S. energy information administration, totally about 123.73 billion gallons were consumed in the United States in 2020 (\url{https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23\&t=10}), and this gives us a rough idea about how many gallons of fuel would be wasted due to traffic jams per year.  Moreover, each vehicle generates about 30 TB of data on average in one day, leading to the traffic demands from vehicles to the Internet skyrocketing.  Since most vehicular applications are delay-sensitive, designing a task offloading strategy is of particular importance in terms of facilitating smart cities.  Therefore, the task offloading strategies developed in this project and tested by real-world traffic are extremely useful for realizing smart cities. In addition, machine learning technologies will be leveraged to design these strategies. This offers a new approach for researchers in the community to use AI techniques to craft cost-effective algorithms.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
