title: "Project 1: Mobile Edge Computing-empowered Task Offloading in the Internet of Vehicles"
excerpt: "This project aims to design task offloading schemes for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the assistance of mobile edge computing.  We began with an overview of in-vehicle networking, where the current in-vehicle networking technologies are summarized, compared, and analyzed.  We advocated automotive Ethernet and presented a priority-based scheduler to reduce the cost of wire harnesses and guarantee delay-constrained performance. With the Ethernet being installed in vehicles, the barrier for vehicular communications and networking is significantly lowered.  After briefly discussing the essential elements of the Internet of autonomous vehicles, such as architecture, features, and socio-technological issues, we plan to propose a three-layer task offloading scheme for the intelligent IoV with the aim of minimizing the overall energy consumption while satisfying the delay constraint of end users.   Due to the extraordinarily complex nature of the problem in question, we will devise a deep reinforcement machine learning technique-based method.  Performance evaluations for our proposed method and their optimized variations will be conducted using real-world taxicab data in Shanghai and Hangzhou, China.  Our approach is expected to be highly practical and efficient for task offloading and intelligent caching in large-scale vehicular networks."

title: "Project 2: Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications in 5G Networks"
excerpt: "The objective of this project is to mitigate the interference in device-to-device (D2D) communications that are underlaid in and coexist with cellular communications from a resource management perspective.  Using game theory, we first designed a resource allocation mechanism for intercell D2D communications.  Specifically, the problem in which two base stations located in two neighboring cells compete for bandwidth allocation quote to a D2D link appearing in the overlapping area of the two adjacent cells was investigated.  This investigation was then extended to a new one where the game information was incomplete.  It is worth noting that the extended version revealed a better performance than the previous version (with complete/perfect information) in terms of sum rate and that it is more realistic in the sense of matching real-world scenarios.  In addition to the spectrum resources allocation, we also explored the issue of how to reduce the interference to cellular users and prolong the lifetime of the user devices in parallel by controlling the user devicesâ€™ power.  A power control algorithm was subsequently devised in the presence of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer technique, which empowers the devices to transmit data and harvest energy simultaneously.  Regarding how to use the harvested energy, a slew of online energy scheduling policies was developed based on the arrival properties of energy signals."
