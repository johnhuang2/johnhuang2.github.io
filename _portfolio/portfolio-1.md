title: "Project 1: Resource Management for Mobile Terminal Collaborations in Space-Air-Ground Networks"
excerpt: "In this project, we aim to establish foundations both in theory and practice for developing Ground-Air-Space (GAS) networks. We propose a systematic investigation of the theoretical framework, the implementation techniques, and the system evaluation methods regarding resource management for mobile terminal collaborations (MTC). Since the system performance varies in the presence of incomplete information, we must study the resource management for MTC under such an assumption. We focus specifically on resource optimization essentials - novel models, algorithms, protocol design, and system performance evaluation will be our primary research efforts. Leveraging advanced mathematical tools, such as convex optimization theory, game theory, and stochastic geometry, the newly developed methods will be validated per theoretical analysis, numerical computation, simulation experiments, and system-implementation-based tests."
