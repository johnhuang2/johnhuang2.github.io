My research interests generally include computer networking and mobile computing. In particular, my primary research focuses on developing system-performance-oriented optimization techniques and Quality-of-Service control mechanisms for emerging access networks. I'm currently interested in designing distributed machine learning algorithms for performance improvement in 6G communication systems.
